# landing-page

This project involved creating a landing page based on a design provided by the Odin Project, which included images of the complete website and details about the fonts and colors. The design source was images from the Odin Project, with additional resources from Pexels.

I used HTML to structure the content and CSS to style the page according to the design. I managed version control with Git, integrated links and images, and utilized Flexbox for layout management.

Completing this project reinforced my skills in HTML, CSS, Git, and Flexbox, providing a comprehensive exercise in translating design mockups into a functional webpage.
